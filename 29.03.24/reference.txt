It provides two options : 
 a) Download the NOAA (GOES-16 or GOES-17 satellite)
 b) Get the data from Zoom.earth (Takes the screenshot from Zoom.earth)
In both cases, satellite images are downloaded from the site. Then a directory is created for all the downloaded images and files are processed and extracted based on various parameters like time stamps. Finally, the images are converted into a video or visual purposes or converted into a video file.

But both GOES-16 and GOES-17 cover the areas of USA and some nearby places so Cannot be used for India

Findings: I think Zoom.earth screenshots can be used and after studying the geosat code and making appropriate changes, it can be useful.
